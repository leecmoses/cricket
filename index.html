                received by 11:59PM ET on August 2, 2020 in order to enter. If
                you submit your entry via your wireless phone, message and data
                rates may apply. Please consult your wireless-service provider
                regarding its message and data pricing plans. All information
                submitted by entrants is subject to and will be treated in a
                manner consistent with Sponsor’s Privacy Policy. By
                participating in the Sweepstakes, entrants hereby agree that
                they have read and accepted the Sponsor’s Privacy Policy and
                agree that Sponsor may collect and use their personal
                information in compliance with Sponsor’s Privacy Policy.
                Sponsor’s Privacy Policy is accessible at
                https://www.cricketwireless.com/privacy. There is a limit of one
                (1) entry per person per day. A “day” is understood to mean
                between 12:00am ET and 11:59pm ET. Entries received from any
                person or email address in excess of the above stated limitation
                will be void. You may not enter more times than indicated by
                using multiple email addresses, identities, or devices in an
                attempt to circumvent the Official Rules, as determined within
                Sponsor’s sole discretion. If you use fraudulent methods or
                otherwise attempt to circumvent the Official Rules, your entry
                may be removed from eligibility at the sole discretion of
                Sponsor. Sponsor has the right, in its sole discretion, to
                maintain the integrity of the Sweepstakes, to void entries for
                any reason, including, but not limited to, the use of bots,
                macros or scripts or other technical means for entering. In the
                event of a dispute regarding entries received from multiple
                users having the same e-mail account, the authorized subscriber
                of the e-mail account at the time of entry will be deemed to be
                the entrant and must comply with these Official Rules.
                Authorized email account subscriber is the natural person who is
                assigned the e-mail address by the Internet Service Provider
                (ISP), on-line service provider, or other organization
                responsible for assigning e-mail addresses. Random Drawing &
                Odds of Winning: One (1) Grand Prize winner will be selected by
                Administrator in a random drawing on or about August 3, 2020
                from all eligible entries received and combined throughout the
                Sweepstakes Period. Odds of winning a prize depend on the number
                of the total eligible entries received and combined throughout
                the Sweepstakes Period. Winner Notification: A potential winner
                will be notified by phone and/or e-mail and will be required to
                confirm his/her name, address and phone number or email address,
                as the case may be, within forty-eight (48) hours from when the
                phone call is made or email is sent, as the case may be. If a
                potential winner does not confirm his/her contact information as
                requested within the forty-eight (48) hour time period, then
                time permitting in Sponsor’s sole discretion, an alternate
                potential winner may be selected in a random drawing from among
                all remaining eligible entries received. If a potential winner
                cannot be reached directly within forty-eight (48) hours from
                when the phone call is made or email is sent and/or does not
                meet the eligibility requirements, the potential winner will be
                disqualified and, time permitting in Sponsor’s sole discretion,
                an alternate potential winner may be selected in a random
                drawing from among all remaining eligible entries received. The
                potential winner will be required to execute and return an
